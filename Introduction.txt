Introduction/ Business Problem

One of the important safety challenge in the modern world is to prevent or reduce road accidents. Although road accidents have become a common issue, the time has exceeded to take more steps toward reducing the number of accidents, or atleast reduce the severity of it. So the main point here is to analyse and find the main cause of these accidents. If it is found, the upcoming accidents or the severity of an accident can be predicted and there by giving some warning messages or alerts, the number of accidents/fatalities can be reduced. For example, if it is a heavy rainy day, there can be a possibility of vehicles to skid from the certain surface (road), or the condition of some roads may be very poor. So there by creating a warning to take diversion or not to pass through a particular way, may reduce a chance of an accident. It will be helpful if we can predict possiblity of an accident, also the severity of the accidents. initially we need to discover the causes of why these accident has occured, so that we can generate warning to the public for taking particular precautions.

The proposed work will be helpful to the public of Seattle, especially, for the one who drives a vehicle. This system will alert the drivers about the possibility of an accident by predicitng a severity condition based on the some features like weather condition, condition of the road,  lighting condition etc.
