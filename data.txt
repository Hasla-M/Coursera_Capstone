--Data-- 


For builiding the a road accident severity prediction system, we need to have data on previous accidents in Seattle. The dataset i've used includes all types of collisions from 2004 onwards, by SDOT Traffic Management Division, Traffic Records Group, Seattle.  It contains 38 attributes including severity code which is a code that corresponds to the severity of the collision, junction type, road condition, weather, number of injured and fatalities, etc.  We doesn't require all the attributes. 
Our target field will be severity code, because we need to predict the severity of the accident. Some attributes have null values, some attributes are not contributing anything to this work. we will find the best attributes through correlation analysis and plotting against target variable, which will give a better prediction and the remaining will be removed while data wrangling process.
